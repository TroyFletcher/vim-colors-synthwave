Coffee License V1.0

Copyright (c) 2022 Troy Fletcher

This software is free as in Coffee.

A cup of Coffee helps you focus on important things, and complete
tasks more quickly, just like using someone else's software.

A cup of Coffee is not infinitely duplicable, as such, intentionally
creating multiple copies of this software requires multiple licenses.

A cup of Coffee may be spooned, but not forked; received, but not
distributed; and Enjoyed, but not sublicensed. The same is true of
this software.

A cup of Coffee, and this software, should be Enjoyed as offered and
unmodified, but Cream And Sugar are acceptable. Anything more must be
first asked of Your Host.

A cup of Coffee may be shared by Your Host with friends, but not
businesses, corporations, LLCs, governments, NGOs, nor any other form
of logical, or otherwise incorporeal organizations (they have mouths
but cannot drink). Only individuals, for individual purposes.

A license for intentional posession and indefinite Enjoying of this
software may be purchased from Your Host for the local cost of a cup
of Coffee.

IF THIS SOFTWARE
IS NOT WORTH
A CUP OF COFFEE
YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT

If you do not accept the terms of Your Host within this license, you
are required to forget (or convincingly feign desremembering), the
content of this software. Failure to forget the concepts, meta-code,
algorithms, or the logical patterns of this software constitutes
violation of all applicable laws in all applicable countries on all
applicable planets, and basically makes you the biggest criminal in
the galaxy, which is really quite impressive.

If this license is not suitable for your use, you are invited to
attempt to make arrangements outside this license directly with Your
Host. Preferrably over Coffee.

Definitions:

"Coffee" refers to all forms of beverages commonly produced by passing
water in some state of matter through the roasted and ground seeds
(hereafter refrerred to as "Beans") or leaves of an appropriate
botanical resource. Where local beverages vary, "Coffee" may be
replaced with any alternative local beverage of repose. Exclusions:
Instant coffee.

"Your Host" refers to the copyright holder.

"Enjoy(ed)(ing)(er)" refers to the act of executing, or sending
machine code, or any translation of any logical instructions of this
software to a CPU, or any other physical expression of logical units
of any size, abstraction, complexity, or material.

"Cream And Sugar" refers to trivial modification to function inputs
and outputs to suit a license holder's use case. Such modifications
may not change the original purpose of any part of the software. If
nontrivial modification is required, Your Host invites you to use
other means to pre-process inputs and/or post-process outputs.
